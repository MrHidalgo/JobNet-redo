          <h3>Privacy Policy for JobNet.com.mm</h3>
          <p>Welcome to JobNet.com.mm (the “Site”).<br>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business.<br>This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site (“Visitors”) who visit without<br>transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered by JobNet.com.mm (collectively, “Services”) (“Authorized Customers”).</p>
          <h5>Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
          <p>refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information.

An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.</p>
          <h5>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</h5>
          <p>We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site .
